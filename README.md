  **- Goal:**

  **-  Chart Insights:**
In the area chart, yellow represents the budget, and green represents revenue.
As the years go by, both budget and revenue increase.
Importantly, there's no year where the budget exceeds the revenue.
This suggests that, on average, movies generate more revenue than their budgets.
While it doesn't guarantee profits every year, it shows a trend of more revenue than budget.
So, investing in the movie industry seems like a good idea because, over time, movies tend to generate more money than they cost to produce.
